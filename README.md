## REVAMP CREATOR MEDIA KIT PAGE

My changes: 	
1.	Reorganization of components: I moved the components to improve the structure and readability of the code.

2.	Aesthetic improvements: Made adjustments to the presentation and arrangement of elements to improve visual appearance.

3.	Removal of unnecessary comments: I removed redundant comments that did not provide useful information.

4.	Since the influencer information is obtained from the server https://blitz-backend-nine.vercel.app in the format /api/creators/username, adjust the code to make the request to this URL instead of simulating the fetch of data.
